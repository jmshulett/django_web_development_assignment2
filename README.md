# django_web_development_assignment 4 building a social website

1. Had trouble installing a few of the packages, had to upgrade pip
2. Had problems with putting the files in the correct directies, which caused certain html pages not show, got template not found errors
3. Experienced some issues with the facebkook and google configurations screens
4. Had an issue with port 80 on my machine so i used port 2000 instead to get the server running
5. I did enjoy the videos and the code walk throughs, very insightful when rewatching them to resolve the issues i faced
